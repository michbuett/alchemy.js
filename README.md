> “Medicine, and Law, and Philosophy -  
You've worked your way through every school,  
Even, God help you, Theology,  
And sweated at it like a fool.   
Why labour at it any more?  
You're no wiser now than you were before.  
...  
A dog could stand this life no more.  
And so I've turned to magic lore;  
The spirit message of this art  
Some secret knowledge might impart.  
No longer shall I sweat to teach   
What always lay beyond my reach;   
I'll know what makes the world revolve,  
Its mysteries resolve,  
No more in empty words I'll deal -  
Creation's wellsprings I'll reveal!”   
  ― Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Faust: First Part
