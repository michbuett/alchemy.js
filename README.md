alchemy.js
==========
It is the framework for every ambitious young developer who wants to master the occult arts of Javascript.
Well, it is going to be. First of all it is a playgound where I can test my ideas and where I can improve my
programmer skills.

So far I was able to come up with:
* ... an advanced <a href="https://github.com/michbuett/alchemy.js/wiki/Potions">type system</a>, incuding mixins and a convenient way to call an overridden method
* ... a <a href="https://github.com/michbuett/alchemy.js/wiki/Potions">module system</a> that works in a browser and with node.js
* ... an easy, powerful and blazing fast templating mechanism
* ... and an event system which is - in my opinion - even more powerful than the one of jQuery or Underscore.js
